- Run/test the REST endpoints using the API documentation generated by Quart-Schema(http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs) 
or using an API client like httpie or curl.
- In order to run via httpie, use the following the commands:
  - For POST /users API(creating a user): ```http 127.0.0.1:5000/users username=test password=test```
  - For GET/login(authenticate a user): ```http --auth test:test 127.0.0.1:5000/login```
  - For POST /users/{username}/games(create a game): ```http POST 127.0.0.1:5000/users/test/games```
  - For GET /users/{username}/games/{game_id}(check the state of a game): ```http GET 127.0.0.1:5000/users/test/games/<enter game id>```
  - For POST /users/{username}/games/{game_id}(play a game): ```http POST 127.0.0.1:5000/users/test/games/<enter game id> guess=cakes```
  - For GET /users/{username}/games(get the list of in-progress games): ```http 127.0.0.1:5000/users/test/games```
